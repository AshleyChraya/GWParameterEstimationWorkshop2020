# Getting started with bilby: simple BBH PE

In this interactive session, we'll go through a variety of materials to get started with parameter estimation of binary black hole systems (BBH). You should feel free to go at your own pace, ask question, try the challenges. If you don't make it all the way through that is quite okay. The main idea is to get stuck in and start learning where things are.

## Installation
* If you want to run the notebooks locally, go through the [installation steps](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/GWParameterEstimationWorkshop2020/blob/master/pages/installation.md)
* **Alternatively** you can run them in the cloud, instructions available [here](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/GWParameterEstimationWorkshop2020/tree/master/notebooks)

## Materials
1. [Tutorial for parameter estimation on simulated data with an injected GW150914-like signal](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/GWParameterEstimationWorkshop2020/blob/master/notebooks/parameter_estimation_injection_tutorial.ipynb)
2. [Tutorial for parameter estimation on open data containing GW150914](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/GWParameterEstimationWorkshop2020/blob/master/notebooks/parameter_estimation_open-data_tutorial.ipynb). *Note, this tutorial is heavily based on the [GWOSC ODW #3](https://github.com/gw-odw/odw-2020), on [this page](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/GWParameterEstimationWorkshop2020/blob/master/pages/gwodw.md) Greg goes through this in detail.*
