# GW Parameter Estimation Workshop 2020
This forked repo contains some of my experiment with codes (adding some codes inspired from the original ones, altering original codes for better understanding etc.) in the original repo. Nothing novel from my side is added nor should be expected to this already excellent set of lectures stitched together by Dr. Greg Ashton.



Repository of materials for the August GW Parameter Estimation workshop on behalf of the Astrophysical Relativity group at ICTS-TIFR in Bangalore, India, as well as the larger Indian GW community.

## Overview
* Pre-workshop material
  * [Installation](pages/installation.md), *recommended*: This page goes through the installation steps for bilby and bilby_pipe 
  * [Getting started: GW-ODW](pages/gwodw.md), *optional*: This page goes through the parameter estimation tutorial from the 2020 GWOSC Open Data Workshop, covering many of the introductory concepts we will hit in this workshop.
  
* Session 1 (August 27th 14:00-16:30 IST)
  * [Introduction to Bayesian inference and Gravitational-Wave parameter estimation](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/GWParameterEstimationWorkshop2020/blob/master/presentations/GWPE_workshop2020_day1.pdf) (Greg) -- [Lecture Video](https://youtu.be/basIiPav4tg)
